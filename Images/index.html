    <p>Beef biryani is a renowned, aromatic, and deeply flavorful rice dish popular in Pakistani and Indian cuisines, often featured as a centerpiece for special occasions, Eid, and weekend feasts. It consists of succulent, tender marinated beef—typically cooked until falling apart—layered with fragrant, long-grain basmati rice. The meat is prepared as a thick, rich curry (gravy) using a complex blend of spices such as cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, garlic, and red chili, often enhanced with yogurt, tomatoes, and sometimes potatoes. The entire dish is typically cooked using the "dum" method, a slow-steaming process that allows the flavors to meld together, resulting in a perfectly balanced, aromatic, and savory one-pot meal often served with raita (yogurt dip) or salad.</p>
