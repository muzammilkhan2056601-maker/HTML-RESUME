    <h1 id="Beff">Beff Biryani</h1>
    <p>Beef biryani is a renowned, aromatic, and deeply flavorful rice dish popular across South Asia, particularly in Pakistani and Indian cuisines. It features tender, succulent morsels of beef marinated in a mixture of yogurt, ginger, garlic, and robust spices like cumin, cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon. This meat mixture, or gravy, is layered with parboiled, fragrant basmati rice, creating a rich texture and complex taste profile. Often prepared for special occasions, celebrations, or Sunday feasts, the dish is characterized by its vibrant color, smoky aroma, and sometimes includes ingredients like potatoes, fried onions, and kewra or rose water. The components are sealed together and slow-cooked using the "dum" method, allowing the rice to steam and infuse with the savory flavors of the meat. It is commonly served hot with side dishes such as raita (yogurt dip), kachumber salad, or pickled vegetables.</p>

    <h1 id="White Pulao">White Pulao</h1>
    <p>White Pulao, often referred to as Yakhni Pulao, is a fragrant and traditional South Asian rice dish renowned for its subtle flavors and aromatic, stock-based cooking method. Unlike biryani, which is heavily spiced and layered, white pulao is prepared by cooking rice directly in a rich broth (yakhni) derived from chicken, mutton, or beef, combined with a delicate blend of whole spices such as cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and cumin. A defining characteristic of this dish is its mild color, achieved by limiting the use of turmeric or dark caramelized onions, which allows the subtle, aromatic spices to dominate the flavor profile. It is often embellished with yogurt, green chilies, and coriander for added texture and mild heat. Typically served with raita or kachumber salad, white pulao is considered a comforting, yet elegant, staple dish often prepared during special occasions like Eid.</p>
